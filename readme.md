Vehicle Path Planning Simulation Using Genetic Algorithms:

Developed a Python-based simulation to optimize vehicle path planning for parking scenarios using genetic algorithms.
Implemented and tuned genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions over generations.
Utilized mathematical models and cubic spline interpolation for dynamic control of vehicle steering and velocity.
Designed and executed simulations to minimize a custom cost function based on the vehicle's final position, orientation, and velocity, ensuring compliance with spatial constraints.
Enhanced solution robustness and efficiency by integrating evolutionary strategies like elitism and fitness evaluation.
Visualized vehicle trajectories and control variable evolution using matplotlib, facilitating detailed analysis and optimization.
Achieved successful automation of vehicle parking maneuvers within predefined boundary conditions, significantly improving algorithmic efficiency and accuracy.
