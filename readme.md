# Vehicle Path Planning Using Genetic Algorithms

## Objective
This project aims to optimize vehicle path planning for specific parking scenarios utilizing genetic algorithms to automate the maneuvering of vehicles into designated parking spots.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy

## Key Features
- **Population Initialization**: Begins with a random initialization of the population using binary strings that represent control variables for steering and velocity.
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Utilizes a custom cost function that evaluates each solution based on the vehicle's final position, orientation, and velocity.
- **Genetic Operations**: Employs selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve the population through generations, enhancing solution quality iteratively.
- **Control Interpolation**: Implements cubic spline interpolation to ensure smooth transitions between control points generated by the genetic algorithm.
- **Visualization**: Generates detailed plots using Matplotlib to visualize the vehicle's trajectory, steering angles, and velocity profiles during simulations.

## Simulation Details
- **Spatial Constraints**: The vehicle must navigate complex spatial constraints without collisions.
- **Integration Method**: Uses the Euler method to simulate real-time dynamics of the vehicle under various control inputs.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Plots are dynamically generated to monitor the trajectory and control variable changes, aiding in the optimization process.

## Performance
- The algorithm is designed to efficiently find optimal or near-optimal solutions within pre-defined generational or time constraints.
- Demonstrates the successful automated parking of vehicles, validating the genetic algorithm's effectiveness.

## Output
- **Final State Visualization**: At the end of each successful simulation, the final state values and trajectory plots are displayed.
- **Data Export**: Control variables are saved to a file upon achieving a successful parking scenario, which can be used for further analysis or implementation.

## Usage
- **Research and Development**: Ideal for R&D teams working on autonomous vehicle navigation systems.
- **Adaptability**: The framework can be adapted or extended to other types of dynamic control simulations that require optimization of operational parameters.
